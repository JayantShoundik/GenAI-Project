Artificial intelligence is a transformative field of computer science. It focuses on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. The history of AI is rich, with foundational concepts laid out by pioneers like Alan Turing, who proposed the Turing Test to measure a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.
